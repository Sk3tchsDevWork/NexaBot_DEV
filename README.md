  - The user is warned with a customizable message.
  - Offenses are logged, and repeated offenses result in auto-muting.

### **XP and Leveling**
- Users earn XP for positive actions and lose XP for negative actions.
- Leveling up is based on XP, with customizable level-up messages.
- Admins can manually adjust XP and configure XP gain rates.

### **Achievements and Challenges**
- Tracks user activity and awards badges for milestones.
- Daily challenges encourage engagement and reward users with XP.

### **Event Management**
- Admins can create, list, delete, and send reminders for events.
- Events are stored per guild and displayed in a formatted list.
